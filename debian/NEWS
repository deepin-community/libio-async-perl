libio-async-perl (0.39-1) unstable; urgency=low

  The Loop API has changed once again. The loops which have been
  packaged for Debian, namely:
  - IO::Async::Loop::Epoll (libio-async-loop-epoll-perl)
  - IO::Async::Loop::Glib (libio-async-loop-glib-perl)
  have already been brought up-to-date.

libio-async-perl (0.24-1) unstable; urgency=low

  This version introduces a new Loop API, which means loops written
  against older versions of libio-async-perl (IO::Async) will no
  longer work.

  The loops which have been packaged for Debian, namely:
  - IO::Async::Loop::Epoll (libio-async-loop-epoll-perl)
  - IO::Async::Loop::Glib (libio-async-loop-glib-perl)
  have already been brought up-to-date.
